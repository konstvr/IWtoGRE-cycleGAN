# Synthetic T2*-weighted gradient echo from IW fat suppressed sequences of the knee 

## About The Model
This Generative Adversarial Network is a first-of-its-kind machine learning model that synthesizes T2* Gradient Echo (GRE) from Intermediate Weighted fat-suppressed images of the knee. It is based on the cycleGAN architecture and has been trained on a dataset consisiting of knee examinations from 820 patients (15000+ images). As recommended by the [Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM)](https://pubs.rsna.org/page/ai/claim) this repository contains the trained model and a UI, which can be used to quickly create GRE from IW images.
